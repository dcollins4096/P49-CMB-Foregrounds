Through numerical magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulations we examine the E/B
power spectra of the polarized multiphase interstellar medium (ISM) over a wide
swath of dust parameter space. We describe the relative importance of gas
pressure and magnetic field pressure on the shape of the E and B power spectra
recently observed by Planck in their search for the B-modes of primordial
gravitational waves in the polarized Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). We describe our findings and how they impact our
understanding of the polarized dust foregrounds.
